# zedboard-morse-code-translator

This program is a two way translator between morse code and ascii using the Vivado Zedboard. To make the OLED display functional, I used Texas A&M's ip, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ldolson/ZedboardOLED-v1.0-IP).

## How to load onto your ZedBoard

Make sure you have Vitis installed

1. Clone or Download the repository

`git clone https://github.com/j792lee/zedboard-morse-code-translator.git`
